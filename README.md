# HR_Analytic (Ford Sentence Classification Dataset)

## Goals
This project aims to develop a job description analysis model to identify, categorize, and align the required competencies with company needs during the CV screening stage, thereby making the process more efficient and accurate

## Problem Statement

- Traditional CV screening struggles to systematically identify candidate characteristics.

- No automated model existed to classify CV contents into categories such as Responsibility, Skill, Education, and Soft Skills.

- Manual processes were time-consuming and prone to bias

## Methodology

1. Data Preparation – Text cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, and oversampling (SMOTE).

2. Feature Engineering – Used TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and GloVe vectorization.

3. Model Development & Tuning – Compared SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, Naïve Bayes, and KNN.

4. Evaluation Metrics – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix.

5. Deployment – Implemented via Streamlit app for recruiters to analyze CV text.
